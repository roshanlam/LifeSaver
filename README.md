# Problem 
We are living in a world where people believe that being unhappy is a choice. It's 2019, and we might be on a breakthrough in medical science for neurology, oncology, etc, but depression or anxiety is not even considered a medical issue. Depression is a real thing, it is not something that can easily be shaken. People dealing with depression want to tell their stories to somebody but they are mostly afraid to speak to their close friends and relatives. 
# Solution
I have built a chatbot that willtalk to you like the best friend you have never met and ask you about your problems indirectly and eventually help find you solutions. When you are feeling suicidal, it will connect you to actual support groups near you.
